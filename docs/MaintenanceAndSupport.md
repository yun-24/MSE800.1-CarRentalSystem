# Maintenance and Support
## Maintenance Strategies
Regular Updates: Ensure the system is regularly updated with security patches and new features.

Code Reviews: Implement regular code reviews to maintain code quality and catch potential issues early.

Automated Testing: Use automated testing to validate changes and prevent regressions.

## Versioning
Semantic Versioning: Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to manage releases.

MAJOR: Incompatible changes

MINOR: Backward-compatible features

PATCH: Backward-compatible bug fixes

Release Notes: Document all changes in release notes for each version.

## Backward Compatibility
Deprecation Policy: Clearly communicate deprecated features and provide alternatives before removal.

Compatibility Layers: Implement compatibility layers to support older versions of the system.

User Feedback: Collect user feedback to understand the impact of changes and adjust accordingly.
